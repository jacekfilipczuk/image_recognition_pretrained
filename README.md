# image_recognition_pretrained
Using a pretrained model to classify an input dataset of unlabeled images

The idea is to use a pretrained model like inception v3 to automatically tag images from an input folder.

Another usage would be to automatically remove images from a folder that do not match a specific set of labels given by the prediction of the model.
